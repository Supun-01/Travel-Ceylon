As well as covering the key sights she also took us to a fantastic local restaurant, one of the best meals we had during our stay! We highly recommend Polly for your next adventure!"

Yes, we learned a lot about the area's history but it never felt like a lecture and both Khun Nat and us enjoyed the great day, great weather in beautiful surroundings. Definitely recommend this tour and Khun Nat."
